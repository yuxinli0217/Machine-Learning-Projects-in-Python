During this semester, I began exploring the field of machine learning, and here are some of the topics I covered using Python. 
Initially, I delved into basic linear regression and logistic regression, learning methods for model selection such as Regularization. 
Later on, I explored topics like principle component analysis (PCA), K-means clustering, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.
I'll further delved into Natural Language Processing (NLP) as well.
